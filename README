	DESCRIPTION
*******************************************************************************

This software allows you to create and edit bookmarks on existing pdf files.

*******************************************************************************
	DEPENDENCIES
*******************************************************************************

This software requires a Java Runtime Environment version 6 or later for 
information on how to install one on your system, or to check if you already
have it, go to http://www.java.com or search your system's software
repositories. It uses the following libraries distributed in the lib folder

	HOW TO EXECUTE 
*******************************************************************************

Download the zip or tar.gz archive of the latest version from source-forge
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/jpdfbookmarks/) and extract the folder
jpdfbookmarks-x.x.x to a position on your drive. Inside that folder you have
both the windows executables and the Linux scripts to launch the application.

IMPORTANT: this software requires a Java Runtime Environment version 6 or later
for information on how to install one on your system, or to check if you already
have it, go to http://www.java.com or search your system's software
repositories.

On Windows
==========
To launch the graphical user interface of the program on windows double click
jpdfbookmarks.exe, the program can take the pdf file to open as an argument to
facilitate shell integration. To use the program on the command-line use the
other executable jpdfbookmarks_cli.exe, if you use often the command prompt I
suggest you to add the jpdfbookmarks-x.x.x folder to the PATH environment
variable, you can easily find instructions on how to accomplish this on the web.

On Linux (or similar)
======================
After you have extracted the archive enter the folder jpdfbookmarks-x.x.x and
here you will find a linux_install.sh bash script, execute it from terminal as
root with:

# bash linux_install.sh

the script simply copies the directory to /usr/local/lib an than create two 
symbolic links in /usr/local/bin called jpdfbookmarks (to launch from 
command-line) and jpdfbookamrks_gui (to launch the gui with a splash screen),   
so after the execution you can try to execute the program from the terminal 
with:

$ jpdfbookmarks --help

which should print a short help.

Universal
=========
For all the systems you can launch the program with:

$ java -jar jpdfbookmarks.jar

and on many systems also double clicking on jpdfbookmarks.jar will work.


Here follows a short help on the jpdfbookmarks parameters.

usage: jpdfbookmarks [--dump | --apply <bookmarks.txt> --out <output.pdf> |
                     --help | --version] [input.pdf]

To launch the graphic interface invoke without parameters or pass a pdf file you 
want as parameter. On Windows the command line program must be called with
jpdfbookmarks_cli.exe while the graphic interface must be called with
jpdfbookmarks.exe.

 -a,--apply <bookmarks.txt>  Apply bookmarks from the file bookmarks.txt to a
                             pdf file passed as argument  and save it to a new
                             pdf file specified with --out output.pdf.
 -d,--dump                   Extract bookmarks from a PDF file passed as
                             argument and print them to standard output.
 -h,--help                   Print this message.
 -i,--indentation <arg>      String to use as indentation string (default value
                             is the tab character) , must be different from the
                             title and page number separator (default value '/')
                             and from the attributes separator (default value
                             ',').
 -o,--out <output.pdf>       Output PDF file --out file.pdf or -o file.pdf.  Use
                             with the --apply option.
 -p,--page-sep <arg>         String to be use between title and page number
                             (default value is '/'), must be different from
                             attributes separator (default value ',') and from
                             indentation string (default value is the tab
                             character).
 -t,--attributes-sep <arg>   String to be use between the bookmark attributes
                             (default value is ','), must be different from the
                             title and page number  separator (default value
                             '/') and from indentation string (default value is
                             the tab character).
 -v,--version                Version number.

In the bookmarks.txt file each line is a bookmark and the hierarchy is made by
tab characters (not spaces),in the format <Title of bookmark/target
page[,FitType,TopOffset,LeftOffset] like the following example:
Chapter 1/23
[TAB]Para 1.1/25,FitWidth,96
[TAB][TAB]Para 1.1.1/26,FitHeight,43
Chapter 2/30,TopLeft,120,42
[TAB]Para 2.1/32,FitPage.
It is also possible to use an extended format to specify the text style, the
color and the open or close state of the bookmark, like the following example:
Para 1.1/25,Red,bold,italic,open,FitWidth,96 or
Para 1.1/25,Green,noBold,noItalic,closed,FitWidth,96

*******************************************************************************
	HOW TO BUILD 
*******************************************************************************

My development environment is the JDK 6, I use the Netbeans IDE version 6.7.1
but you can build jpdfbookmarks on the command line using ant if you prefer.
Netbeans have very good subversion integration if you use this IDE I recommend
it, otherwise download an appropriate subversion client for your system, I will
first guide you to build the program in Netbeans and then on the command line.

From the Netbeans menu choose "Team->Subversion->Checkout" and on the dialog
the repository URL to enter is:

https://jpdfbookmarks.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jpdfbookmarks/trunk

click next and you will get to the following another panel, choose trunk as the
repository folder and check "Skip "trunk" and checkout only its content", choose
the local folder, for example:

C:\Users\username\Documents\NetbeansProjects\jpdfbookmarks

and check "Scan for Netbeans Projects after Checkout", then click Finish.
Wait for the download to finish and then you will get a message box, click on
"Open Project ..." and on the opened dialog select the project
jpdfbookmarks_core, check "Open Required" and click Open.

Run the project in Netbeans with F6 key or with the appropriate Run menu item.

If you prefer using the command line download the current source with the
command:

$> svn co https://jpdfbookmarks.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jpdfbookmarks/trunk jpdfbookmarks

enter the directory containing the main project with:

$> cd jpdfbookmarks/jpdfbookmarks_core

build the project with:

$> ant jar

execute the program with:

$> java -jar dist/jpdfbookmarks.jar

*******************************************************************************
	HOW TO PACKAGE
*******************************************************************************

I have decided not to provide installers for jpdfbookmarks but only archives
containing binaries, the reason is that I prefer spending my time programming
and solving bugs on the code, creating installers for different platforms is 
not an easy task and I hope someone will offer his help to create state of the 
art packages for specific systems.

To create the archives there are two scripts in the Packaging folder, 
packager.bat if you are in Windows, and packager.sh if you are on Linux. 

On Windows
==========
The packager.bat batch script depends on 7zip software to create the archives, 
you must modify the script to use it on your system, find the line:

SET PATH7ZIP="D:\LiberKey\Apps\7Zip\App\7-Zip"

and substitute the path with the 7zip installation folder on your system, than 
simply run the batch file after you have built jpdfbookmarks to create the
zip and tar.gz archives.

On Linux
========
Run the packager.sh script with:

$ sh packager.sh

 

*******************************************************************************
	HOW TO HELP
*******************************************************************************

There are really many ways to help a small GPL project like this, here I give 
some hints but feel free to offer any other idea you have.

- report bugs;
- correct bugs submitting patches;
- write documentation or tutorials;
- write translations of the program or of the documentation;
- create better icons;
- suggest new features;
- create Installers; 
...

For more instructions and information go to my blog 
http://flavianopetrocchi.blogspot.com/ or to 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jpdfbookmarks/ please post your comments and bug
reports.

I hope this will help you getting your job done, let me know.

Best Regards,

Flaviano Petrocchi
